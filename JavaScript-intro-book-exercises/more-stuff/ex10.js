let x = "5";
x = x + 1 /// '51'

let y = "5"
y++
// return value is the numeric value 5, ++ applied to a string coerces it into a number, after the coercion is it then incremented to the value of 6

// post-increment operator y++ returns the original value of y, not the incremented value like the pre-increment operator does
